VRQR is a program that lets you scan QR codes from within VRChat.

Simply have the program running whenever you're in VRChat, and take a photo of a QR code using the in-game camera.

VRQR will scan every photo taken for a QR code and automatically launch the URL in your default browser if one is detected.
